# Firebase Setup Guide

Your application has been successfully migrated to a **Serverless Architecture** using Firebase!
You no longer need a Node.js backend.

## Step 1: Configure Authentication
1. Go to your [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/).
2. Click **Build** > **Authentication**.
3. Click **Get Started**.
4. Select **Email/Password** as the Sign-in provider.
5. Enable the **Email/Password** switch.
6. Click **Save**.

## Step 2: Create Your First User
Since we don't have a backend to seed the database, you need to create your admin user manually in the console:
1. In the **Authentication** tab, click **Add user**.
2. **Email**: `admin@farm.app`
3. **Password**: `admin123` (or any password you like).
4. Click **Add user**.

*Note: The login screen accepts simple usernames like `admin` and automatically converts them to `admin@farm.app`.*

## Step 3: Create the Database
1. Click **Build** > **Firestore Database**.
2. Click **Create Database**.
3. **Location**: Choose `eur3` (Europe) or `us-central1` (US).
4. **Security Rules**: Select **Start in test mode**.
    *   *Warning: Test mode allows anyone with the config to read/write. For a production app, you should configure rules to allow only authenticated users.*
5. Click **Create**.

## Step 4: Verify Deployment
1. Wait for GitHub Actions to deploy your changes.
2. Open your website URL.
3. Login with credentials from Step 2.

## Note on Local Development
If you do not have `npm` or `node` installed locally, you may see errors when trying to run or build the project on your machine. **This is expected.** Use GitHub Actions to build and deploy your application.
